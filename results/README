FONLL pt(B)>5 GeV abs(eta)<2.8:
sigma = 1.33e+08 + 5.42e+07 - 4.05e+07 pb

filter_efficiency_FONLL_shape.txt :
-----------------------------------
The filter efficiency  starting from GEN Pythia
pt(B)>5 GeV and abs(eta)< 2.8 with the pt(B)
distribution reshaped to FONLL (central/up/down)
to require two GEN muons pt>3 GeV and abs(eta)<2.4

filter_efficiency_Pythia_shape.txt
----------------------------------
This is the same, but without changing the Pythia
pt(B) shape.  Not needed, just curiosity.

weights_shapeOnly_2.8.txt
-------------------------
Weights as a function of Pt(B) to reshape Pythia to
FONLL central/up/down.
Careful, at high Pt stats are a problem, should
maybe truncate to constant around ~ 30-40 GeV
